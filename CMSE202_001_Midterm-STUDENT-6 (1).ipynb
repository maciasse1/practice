    "\n",
    "The goal of this midterm is to give you the opportunity to test out some of the skills that you've developed thus far this semester. In particular, you'll practice setting up a GitHub repository, committing and pushing repository changes, downloading data with command line tools, using a new-to-you Python package, and writing a python class. You should find that you have all of the skills necessary to complete this exam with even just eight weeks of CMSE 202 under your belt!\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to look through the entire exam before you get started so that you can appropriately budget your time and understand the broad goals of the exam. Once you've read through it, try doing Parts 1 and 2 first so that you have your repository set up and you download the provided data files as they will be necessary to complete the assigned tasks. Let your instructor know right away if you have problems downloading the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "The exam is set up so that even if you get stuck on one part there are opportunities to get points on the other parts, so consider jumping ahead if you feel like you aren't making progress and then come back later if you have time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note about using online resources**: This exam is \"open internet\". That means that you can look up documentation, google how to accomplish certain Python tasks, etc. Being able to effectively use the internet for computational modeling and data science is a very important skill, so we want to make sure you have the opportunity to exercise that skill. **However**: The use of any person-to-person communication software is absolutely not acceptable. If you are seen accessing your email, using a chat program (e.g. Slack), or any sort of collaborative cloud storage or document software (e.g. Google Documents), you will be at risk for receiving a zero on the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep your eyes on your screen!** Unfortunately, there isn't enough space in the room for everyone to sit at their own table so please do your best to keep your eyes on your own screen. This exam is designed to give *you* the opportunity to show the instructor what you can do and you should hold yourself accountable for maintaining a high level of academic integrity. If any of the instructors observe suspicious behavior, you will, again, risk receiving a zero."

    "2. Clone the repository onto your computer.\n",

Move this notebook into that repository and then add it and commit it to the repository and push the changes to the remote repository (**Suggestion**: You may want save and close this notebook before you move to the repository and then reopen it after you move it to make sure that you're working with the right copy of the notebook.)\n",

You may lose some points though since you won't have periodic commits as you make progress along the way, but it will be better than not working on the other parts of the exam!"

You might need to review the documentation for `SeqIO`, which you can find [here](http://biopython.org/wiki/SeqIO)\n",

    "## Part 6: Writing a simple Python class (25 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section, you're going to expand on the pre-existing Python class contained in the cell below. The class is called `Student` and, not surprisingly, it is designed to store information about an individual student and currently just includes one simple method, one that prints the student's name. Using this class as a starting point, you goal is to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add a new attribute, `year`, to the class so that it is defined when the class object is first initialized. This attribute will represent how many years the student has been in college. \n",
    "* Add a new class method, `enroll`, that takes as input a list of courses and adds them as an attribute to the student\n",
    "* Add a new class method, `display_courses`, that prints out: <br>\n",
    "\"I am enrolled in: < courses >\" <br>\n",
    "where the < courses > part is filled in with the courses that are added by the `enroll` method.\n",
    "* Add a new class method, `years_until_graduation`, that **returns** the number of years left until the student graduates (assuming that a student typically graduates after 4 years)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, **using the `roster` provided below, create a list of `Student` objects that contain the information for each student. Using your list of students, randomly enroll each of them in two of these three classes: 'CMSE 202', 'ISP 205', or 'HB 409'.** You should enroll the students using your `enroll` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've enrolled all of your students, **use your student list to print the following for every student**:\n",
    "\n",
    ">My name is < name > <br>\n",
    "I am enrolled in < courses > <br>\n",
    "I will graduate in < years until graduation > years.\n",
    "\n",
    "where the appropriate student information is filled in for each part indicated by the < >'s\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **print the average GPA for this list of students**."
